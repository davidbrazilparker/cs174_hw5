Abstract:
For this homework you will create a site: Throw-a-Coin-in-the-Fountain. The idea is that users can come to this site, customize their 
	digital, coin-in-fountain wish, list people they want to share their wish with, select a payment method, charge their wish using 
	Stripe, and receive via mail, along with their shared friends, a link to a PDF that commemorates their wish.

Checklist:
(a) The site should use the MVA pattern and folder structure of HW3 and HW4. 
(b) Only the index.php file is allowed to contain code not in a class. 
(c) All classes should be documented with a phpdoc docblock that says what the class does in a more meaningful way than just the title 
	of the class, all methods need to be documented in a similarly meaningful way and have appropriate @param and @return declarations. 
(d) Your project should be developed using Composer and classes should be loaded not using requires, but using Composer's autoloader. 
	The grader will run composer install to generate the autoloader and to load any needed dependencies, so you can submit an empty vendor
	folder. ** This should be working for the most part right now **
(e) PDF generation should be done using setasign/fpdf which should be a dependency required in your composer.json file. 
(f) Somewhere on your landing page you should let users choose between two different languages, defaulting initially to English, and when 
	you output text on your website you use gettext to output it in the language currently chosen. 
(g) In addition to the wisher's name, your site should collect at least three different customizations on the kind of fountain and that 
	the wisher wants to throw their virtual coin into. A current image of the fountain as customized so-far should be displayed as the 
	user selects customizations. 
(h) When a user has finished creating their wish by entering their credit card info and clicking a "Throw-A-Coin" button, a credit charge 
	should be made using Stripe. The grader should be able to test using the test card numbers at https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards. 
	The Stripe charge amount should always be fixed at a particular amount set in your configs/Config.php file (say $0.25). Stripe API 
	keys should be configured there as well. DO NOT give the grader your live keys. You can leave test keys, but assume the grader will 
	add their own. The Readme.txt file should say if there is anything weird the grader needs to do to set this up. 
(i) If the credit card transaction is not approved an error message should be given, if it is approved a salutory email message containing 
	a unique url to a PDF where the user can download a file commemorating their wish should be sent to the wisher and their shared 
	friends using PHP's mail() function. 
(j) The link mentioned in (i) allows a user to download a PDF of their wish, this PDF should contain all the details of their wish. The 
	link should work to get this wish even if subsequent wishes are made.
